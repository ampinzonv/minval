 ======  MINimal VALidation for stoichiometry reactions v0.5 =======
 ===================================================================
 NOTE please, that this script heavily relies on UNIX command line,
 so, if your intention is to use it in a non UNIX environment, please
 forget it, it just won't work.

 FUNCTIONALITY:
 For a given set of reactions, this script identifies:
 1) All substrates, and their rnxs, that are not present as products.
 2) All products, and their rxns, that are never used as substrates (dead ends).


 INPUT
 A two columns text file (tab separated) with the following mandatory format:
 Column 1: Reaction ID.
 Column 2: Reaction formula.

 CONSIDERATIONS ON INPUT FORMAT:
 This script assumes that all your reactions have the following format:

            L-Glutamate[c] <=> CO2[c] + 4-Aminobutanoate[c]

 Where arrows and plus signs are surrounded by a "space character".
 It is also expected that stoichiometry coefficients are surrounded by spaces,
 (nothe the "2" before the CO2[c] or the NH3[c]): 
 
          H2O[c] + Urea-1-carboxylate[c] <=> 2 CO2[c] + 2 NH3[c]

 It also expects arrows to be in the form "<=", "=>" or "<=>". Meaning that arrows
 like "==>", "<==>" or "<==" will not be parsed and will lead to errors.


 OUTPUT
 This script outputs 5 files into the current folder: 

 INPUT.orphanProducts
       lists all products never used as substrates. Possible dead ends.

 INPUT.orphanProducts.rxns
 		lists all the rxns holding orphan products. 

 INPUT.orphanSubstrates
		lists all substrates never produced in a reaction. Possible candidates to be
		introduced into the system by exchange rxns or by adding more internal rxns.

 INPUT.orphanSubstrates.rxns
		lists all rxns holding orphan substrates.

 INPUT.mets
	Non redundant list of metabolites present in all rxns in input file.
